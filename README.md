## Decription

There are two components to this assignment.  First there is the initial analysis in the jupyter notebook. The dataset that we are analyzing contains precipitation and temperature data in Hawaii that has been collected at nine different weather stations over several years.  

Second, there is a climate app built on Flask that hosts an api for this weather data.  With this api, you can find the min, max, and avg temps for a set date range, amongst other things.    


## Installations

Ensure you have properly install Flask before using the climate app
